# Pollen-MIGseq
Analyzing single cell pollen sequencing with MIGseq libraries

MIGseq uses degnerate primers in a multiplexed PCR reaction to amplify and sequence ISSR (inter-simple sequence repeat) markers by the hundreds or thousands. I modified the MIGseq library prep of Suyama and Matsuki, 2015 to include Adapterama I barcodes (Glenn et al, 2019a) and Adapterama II style primers (Glenn et al, 2019b). 

Our goal is to genotype single pollen grains - better than single cell because pollen is hapolid and has 3 cells each - to detect the location of recombination.  Although a proof of concept is complete, this project is largely a work in progress.
